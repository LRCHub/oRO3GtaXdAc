Go!

Well, if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time
(Take a good hard look)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out, right now!

Guitar!

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you'd read me like a book
But the pages are all torn and frayed, now...

I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay now

But you really need to listen to me
'Cause I'm telling you the truth
I mean this ever since's true, I am (trust me)

Not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Let me tell you something)
I'm not okay
