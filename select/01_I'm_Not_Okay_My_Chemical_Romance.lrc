[00:26.40] Well, if you wanted honesty
[00:28.76] That's all you had to say
[00:31.72] I never want to let you down
[00:34.14] Or have you go, it's better off this way
[00:54.14] 
[00:37.55] For all the dirty looks
[00:39.71] The photographs your boyfriend took
[00:42.41] Remember when you broke your foot
[00:44.75] From jumping out the second floor?
[01:01.75] 
[00:47.71] I'm not okay, I'm not okay
[00:56.75] I'm not okay
[01:02.13] You wear me out
[01:09.63] 
[01:09.08] What will it take to show you
[01:11.42] That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
[01:14.63] I've told you time and time again
[01:16.72] You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
[01:47.72] 
[01:20.24] To be a joke and look
[01:22.41] Another line without a hook
[01:25.04] I held you close as we both shook
[01:27.48] For the last time, take a good hard look
[01:47.48] 
[01:30.40] I'm not okay, I'm not okay
[01:39.79] I'm not okay
[01:44.89] You wear me out
[01:52.39] 
[02:07.75] Forget about the dirty looks
[02:10.44] The photographs your boyfriend took
[02:13.10] You said you read me like a book
[02:15.75] But the pages all are torn and frayed
[02:34.25] 
[02:18.62] I'm okay, I'm okay
[02:27.10] I'm okay now (I'm okay, now)
[02:41.10] 
[02:33.35] "But you really need to listen to me"
[02:35.13] "Because I'm telling you the truth"
[02:37.03] "I mean this, I'm okay!" (Trust me)
[02:54.53] 
[02:39.65] I'm not okay, I'm not okay
[02:46.38] Well, I'm not okay
[02:47.94] I'm not o-fucking-kay
[02:49.58] I'm not okay, I'm not okay
