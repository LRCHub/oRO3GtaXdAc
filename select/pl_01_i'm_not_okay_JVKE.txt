You can kiss my love goodbye
Your lipstick stains washed with
Tears i cry
For the first time in a while
I can see through the lies
Bringing secrets to light
How could i be
So naive to
Think i had you?
Maybe i'm just
Dumb
I'm a fool
So naive
I guess i should've known
You don't love me
Ooh
You don't love me
Maybe i'm just dumb
Down bad
All my friends say you're the
worst
Down bad
But i can't see it, vision
blurred
I know i look
Kinda crazy(crazy,crazy)
Ooh yeah
But i'm feelin' good
As of lately(lately,lately)
Ooh yeah
I let you live in my brain
'cause i kinda like the pain
Breathe,breathe
I'm not okay
Yeah,i'm broken by you, ohh
I'm not okay
That's A-OK with me
